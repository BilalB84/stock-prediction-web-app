# SafeStock AI Web Application 🔮
## Real-Time Stock Forecasting & Analysis Using LSTM Models 🤖
SafeStock AI is a web-based application that combines real-time stock market data with AI-driven forecasting to provide actionable insights on stocks.   
It leverages LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for time-series forecasting, offering users predictions and technical analysis for better understanding market trends.


## Demo App

## Key Features
📈 Real-Time Stock Prices: Stay updated with dynamic market data from Yahoo Finance.
🤖 AI Predictions: View the next 5-day stock price forecasts, powered by advanced LSTM models.
📊 Technical Analysis: Explore trends with indicators like SMA, EMA, RSI, and OBV using interactive charts.
📋 Performance Metrics: Dive into AI model accuracy with evaluation details and key variables.


## How It Works
The app is powered by:

-  Data Preprocessing: Historical stock data is cleaned, scaled, and prepared for analysis.
- LSTM Model: A robust time-series forecasting algorithm trained to predict stock price movements.
- Visualization: Interactive charts display historical trends, technical indicators, and model predictions.

Models & Methodology
Model Overview
The core of SafeStock AI is an LSTM neural network, specifically designed for sequential data like time-series. The model is trained on historical stock prices to predict future movements.

## Model Features
Input Variables: 
    
    Garman-Klass Volatility
    Dollar Volume
    On Balance Volume (OBV)
    Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
    Moving Averages (MAs)

Evaluation Metrics:
    
    RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
    MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
    R² (Coefficient of Determination)

Technical Indicators:
  
    SMA (Simple Moving Average): Tracks short-term trends.
    EMA (Exponential Moving Average): Highlights momentum.
    RSI (Relative Strength Index): Analyzes overbought/oversold conditions.
    OBV (On-Balance Volume): Measures buying/selling pressure.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for more stocks and global markets.
- Incorporate additional AI models like GRU and ARIMA for comparative analysis.
- Deploy for scalability on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
- Provide user-defined customization for technical indicators.
